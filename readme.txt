This was the final project for my introductory R class. It focuses on arson data collected from 2006 to 2015 throughout the United States. There was no specific rules on what we could do with the data; instead, the project was very freeform, and results were contingent on each student’s experience with statistics. Please note that I completed this project before I took any courses on intermediate model building techniques, so the extent of statistical work that I did with the data was limited.

The data set was too large to upload to Github, but you can follow this link to obtain all of the files and reproduce my work:

The main focuses of the class were data cleaning and data visualization. For this final segment of the class, we learned how to make that visualization more interactive for users using Shiny web apps. The link to my web app is here: https://emilymo008.shinyapps.io/arson/
(It will take a while to load because it has to import data frames from the directory—please be patient.)

The most thorough explanation of my work is in documentation.pdf.

The code.R file simply contains all of the raw coding I did to clean the data and to produce the app and analysis. (This is in the Google drive because it requires the data sets to run.)
